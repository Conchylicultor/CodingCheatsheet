# CodingCheatsheet

This document attempt to to keep track of different concepts from the C++ and Python languages. It does not attempt to be a tutorial, nor some guideline, is surely not exhaustive and may even be incorrect. It's mainly done for personal purposes.

The CheatSheet is automatically generated online at **[this address](http://e-pot.xyz/CodingCheatsheet/)** (won't work well on mobile).
