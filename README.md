# CodingCheatsheet

This document attempt to compile my knowledge of the C++ and Python languages in order to keep tracks of the different concepts I learned. This document does not attend to be a tutorial, nor some guideline and is surely not exhaustive.

This cheatsheet is available online [here](http://e-pot.xyz/CodingCheatsheet/).
