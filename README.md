# CodingCheatsheet

This document attempt to to keep tracks of the different concepts I learned from the C++ and Python languages. It does not attend to be a tutorial, nor some guideline and is surely not exhaustive and may even be incorrect. It's mainly done for personal purposes, to refresh my memory after some time without using the language.

This cheatsheet is available online [here](http://e-pot.xyz/CodingCheatsheet/).

int main(int argc, char** argv)

    <td><pre lang="python">
import modulename as mn

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Hi!')
