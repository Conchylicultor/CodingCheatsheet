# CodingCheatsheet

This document attempt to to keep tracks of the different concepts I learned from the C++ and Python languages. This document does not attend to be a tutorial, nor some guideline and is surely not exhaustive. It's mainly done for personal purposes.

This cheatsheet is available online [here](http://e-pot.xyz/CodingCheatsheet/).


## Basic code

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>C++</td> <td>Python</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td colspan="2">Title</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><pre lang="cpp">
int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    return 0;
}
    </pre></td>

    <td><pre lang="python">
import modulename as mn

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Hi!')
    </pre></td>
  </tr>
</table>
